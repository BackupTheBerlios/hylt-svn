The Hylt parser has several edge conditions.  For example, links cannot
span a newline.  For that reason, you should see no link here: [[a link that shouldn't appear
]]
^--- There should be two brackets there, as they have no matching left
brackets.

[ [ [ [ ] ] ] ] <---- Various brackets that don't complete links.

[[[This[link] has brackets embedded in it]]] and an extra bracket at the
beginning and end.

[[Start|This link [doesn't] have embedded brackets]]], but the pretty
text does.
