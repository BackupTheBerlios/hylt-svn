The Hylt parser has several edge conditions.  For example, links cannot
span a newline.  For that reason, you should see no link here: [[a link that shouldn't appear
]]
^--- There should be two brackets there, as they have no matching left
brackets.

[ [ [ [ ] ] ] ] <---- Various brackets that don't complete links.

[[[This[link] has brackets embedded in it]]] and an extra bracket at the
beginning and end.

[[Start|This link [doesn't] have embedded brackets]]], but the pretty
text does.

\[\[This should look like a link in raw Hylt.]] \\\\\\ <--- 3 slashes.

\T\h\e\s\e\ \a\r\e\ \e\s\c\a\p\e\d\ \e\v\e\n\ \t\h\o\u\g\h\ \t\h\e\y \d\o\n\'\t\ \n\e\e\d\ \i\t\.

This line has an unterminated link attempt; it should just not show up. [[Do you see this?  You shouldn't.]
This line also has one. [[This one has a pipe (|) in it, but still shouldn't show up.
