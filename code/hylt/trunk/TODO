There are lots of things that still can be/need to be done with Hylt.
This file attempts to list those things that we know about and are
planning to work on.  Names in parentheses show developers planning
on implementing these.

Core:
   * Better error handling.  Lots of things could probably tank the
     program right now.
   * Tighter separation.  Many variables are stored in a "state"
     dictionary that gets passed around between functions.  This
     should probably be made less prevalent.
   * Configuration file handling.  While there aren't many things
     that need options now, one will be the location of the help
     files--and perhaps there should be a "world help" file (the
     sort that explains how you use the viewer) and a per-instance
     help file (the sort that explains the purpose of a given Hylt
     collection).  A location for storing HTML renders (per-user,
     probably, not per-instance) would also be a good idea.
   * Command-line parsing.  Files passed in should be handled
     better.

Documentation:
   * The Hylt format needs to be documented.  It's not complex, but
     that's no excuse. (phil)

Editing:
   * Autocreate subdirectories if they don't already exist. (phil)

Exporting:
   * The ability to export an entire Hylt collection into XHTML
     (using the code already contributed by c0ffee) would be nice,
     as it could allow scripting to sync up a local Hylt collo with
     a website. (phil)

UI:
   * Online help, implented as Hylt pages, of course! (jwvernon)
   * The ability to move forward in history, instead of following the
     current link. (mandos)
   * Search functionality.  Given a particular name, find files that
     match the search string. (mandos)
   * Search-to-history.  Given a completed search, put the results in
     the forward-history buffer, allowing the user to bounce between
     the pages. (mandos)
