hylt - Hyperlinked Text

Basically a very basic form of text with absolutely minimal markup
(nothing more than [[links]] a la Wikipedia) plus a dead-simple
Python viewer.  Files end in .hylt and are automagically linked
that way; clicking on a link that doesn't exist tells you it doesn't
(and maybe autoinvokes an editor for you?  Maybe too fancy.)  The idea
is for stuff like novel encyclopaedias and the like where Wiki-esque
linkage is handy but the ability to version it into something less
esoteric than Wiki backends (like CVS or SVN) is important.
